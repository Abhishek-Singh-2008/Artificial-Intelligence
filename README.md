#  Artificial Intelligence – Graph Search Algorithms  

This repository contains implementations of classical **AI Graph Search Algorithms**:  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
- **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**  

The repository is designed to help learners understand different search strategies, compare their outputs, and kickstart their journey into AI search algorithms.

##  Features  

###  Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
- Explores graphs **level by level**.  
- Guarantees the **shortest path** (in terms of edges).  

###  Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Explores deep into a branch before backtracking.  
- Finds a path, but **not always the shortest**.  

###  Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)  
- Uses a **heuristic function** (e.g., Manhattan distance).  
- Prioritizes nodes that appear **closest to the goal**.  
- Faster than BFS/DFS in some cases, but **not always optimal**.
