**Here are the codes for better understanding of AI.**
**Graph Search Algorithms**

Explore the fundamentals of graph traversal with Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS).
This project is designed to help learners understand different search strategies, compare their outputs, and kickstart their journey into AI search algorithms.

🚀 Features

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Explores graphs level by level.

Guarantees the shortest path (in terms of edges).

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Explores deep into a branch before backtracking.

Finds a path but not always the shortest.

Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

Uses a heuristic function (like Manhattan distance).

Prioritizes nodes that appear closest to the goal.

Faster than BFS/DFS in some cases, but not always optimal.

💼 What it Contains 

Pathfinding Implementations: Compare BFS and DFS on sample graphs.

Path Lengths & Structures: See discovery order, parents, and distances.

Learning Resource: Great starting point for AI/ML students learning search strategies in AI.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x: Core programming language.

Collections (deque): For BFS queue implementation.

Heapq (for GBFS): To manage the priority queue with heuristics.
